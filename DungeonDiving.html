								<p>As I mentioned this projects purpose was to teach us communication skills as well as how to work with other people on a real project.</p>
								<p>What I was able to contribute to this project was: Enemy AI, Add functionality to the run function to escape from battle, special player ability, Built the combat system(based off of pokemon), added potion functionality, functionality to chests found throught the maps, Add button functionality to various things.</p>
								<p>Through this project I was able to learn the importance of communication, especially working with version control (Tortoise SVN), as well as the development process.</p>
