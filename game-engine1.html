                                <p>This was a solo task that I decided to undertake having little knowlege on what was needed to make a game engine. But the best way to learn something often times to jump in head first. So that's what I did. I could have coppy pasta'd code from my graphics classes but that defeated the purpose of this project. So instead I reference it when necessary and do my own research to build a completely custom game engine that I would like to build a Doom-esque game out of!</p>
								<p>This is not a "completed" project, it is just a current side project that I work on outside of class. Hopefully it gives you an idea of my ability.</p>
								<p>What I contributed to this project was:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Everything!</li>
                                    <li>Well maybe not everything... I used external libraries like glm for math, and stb_image for my textures.</li>
                                    <li>I also had some help from The Cherno on youtube with getting OpenGL up and running.</li>
