								<p>This project took place between my Freshman and Sophomore year, and was mainly something to try ideas and implementations. While this sort of thing can never really be complete, I'm including it because of everything that I have learned from it so far.</p>
								<p>The upper left screenshot is of the first map that was meant to be where you selected which level to play by going to the different "warps". The other 3 screenshots are the world that is linked to the first navigation world.</p>
								<p>Through this solo project I learned a lot about level design, problem solving, building and using tools, writing DRY code, and debugging.</p>
