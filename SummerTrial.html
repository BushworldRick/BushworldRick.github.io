								<p>This project took place between my Freshman and Sophomore year, and was mainly something to try and test out ideas and do some of the things i wanted to do in Dungeon Diving but wasnt able to.</p>
								<p>The upper left screenshot is of the first map that was meant to be where you selected which level to play by going to the different "warps". Time only allowed me to complete one. The other 3 screenshots are the world that is linked to the first navigation world.</p>
								<p>The things I experimented with were the transition between levels, I also decided to try out the physics behind a sidescroller platformer, and to try and figure out Mario style platforms. The only thing that is not original code is the parsing of the map file, which the proffessor covered in my Programming Foundations 2 course, but even that was changed to better fit the project. Everything else was written by yours truly.</p>
								<p>Through this solo project I learned a lot about design work, problem solving, building and using tools, and debugging.</p>
