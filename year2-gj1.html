								<p>This was the second game jam that I decided to take part in and was the first one of the academic year. The main motivation was to try and learn something new instead of doing another python game. So this time we, the group including myself, decided to teach ourselves Unity3D and see if we could produce something reasonable over the weekend. The theme was "it's a feature not a bug" so we decided that at times you would have to clip through a wall, and intentionaly left in non game breking bugs to add to the experience.</p>
								<p>What I contributed to this project was:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Built First map with downloaded Assets from Unity store</li>
									<li>Enemy AI</li>
								</ul>
								<p>This game jam the group had a total of 5 so there was less for me to do, but because this was my first experience with Unity I had to dedicate time to learn enough before I was able to produce any code.</p>
